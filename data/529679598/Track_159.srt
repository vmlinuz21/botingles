Music can help us in many aspects of our lives. It can help us study, for example. The other day, I heard a boy on the radio explain that he listened to a song while he was studying for his university exams and he passed them all! I was surprised because it was a hip hop song. 
In my experience, only classical music is helpful to concentrate while you're reading. For me, it's really relaxing and helps me understand and assimilate what I study. You should try!
