Hello. My name is Valentina. I remember when I left home. I lived in Russia and I went to study in Paris. I met a very nice French student there and I fell in love for the first time. I remember I felt happy every day. It was a wonderful time in my life.

I'm Ian. I started my own business when I was 18. It was an on-line games site. I was very nervous. My office was my bedroom. I worked for 14 hours every day and I often felt tired. I didn't make a lot of money but it was a good experience.

When I was a child, life was great. My parents were kind and my brother was wonderful. My dad was in the army so my family often moved to different cities but I always felt excited to live in a new place and I had lots of friends. Dad was away a lot but he was always home at Christmas.

I was the first person in my family to go to university. My brother opened the envelope. He said 'Well done, Bart. You passed your exams.' I felt really surprised! So I went to university and I studied medicine. I loved it and I was very happy there.
