Steve: Hi Linda. What's in your bag?
Linda: Hi Steve. I bought lots of clothes for Hope's party. What did you buy?
Steve: I bought clothes for the party and some other things. Let's have a look.
Linda: OK. There's this.
Steve: Oh, that's a nice red sweatshirt. I like red. It's a better colour than mine.
Linda: Yes. I looked at a blue sweatshirt but it was too small. This one's bigger.
Steve: I tried a suit but it wasn't big enough so I bought a jacket and trousers.
Linda: Did you buy shoes?
Steve: Well, no, I got these. They're more informal. Do you like them?
Linda: Oh, they're brilliant! I love sandals.
Steve: Thanks. Is that a new handbag?
Linda: No, but these earrings are new. They were cheaper than any of the others so I bought them.
Steve: They're lovely. Do you always wear earrings?
Linda: Yes, and they're lighter than my old ones. Did you buy that shirt?
Steve: Yes, it's more formal than a T-shirt but I like it.
Linda: How lovely. It's really great ...
