1 The Academy Award for the film Parasite was a surprise for many people. It was good, but it wasn’t as good as some of the other nominations. The film comments on social differences between the rich and the poor. At first, it seems to be a comedy but it changes 
gradually into a tragedy. The problem was the action was slow and the final half hour was quite boring. However, the music matches the feelings in the film perfectly and the photography is brilliant.

2 Bong Joon-ho directed the film Parasite, which won an Academy Award in 2019. He is one of South Korea’s most famous filmmakers and also writes and produces films. He has created science fiction films and dramas. He was born in South Korea in 1969 and after
 studying sociology at university, he studied at the Korean Academy of Film Arts. 

3 This week I’m going to tell you about the film Parasite, which I saw last Saturday. It’s very different to the usual romantic ones that I write about but I wanted to share it with you because it was totally special. I went to see it in the original Korean version with subtitles. 
I always prefer to do that because I think the voices are always much better in the original language. It was brilliant, even though the ending was tragic! Although the action is set in Korea, I could see similarities in my culture and I felt it gave me a better understanding of social problems and things people do to survive.
