Pam: OK Alex, what are we going to do this weekend?  

Alex: Hang on, let me look at my tablet.  

Pam: I prefer tablets to smartphones; they work really fast and I hate small screens.  

Alex: Yeah! OK, on Saturday morning, we're meeting for breakfast at Paul's house at 10:30.  

Pam: Lovely! He cooks brilliantly! Then I want to go shopping and buy a guitar. I've taken some lessons but I still play very badly!  

Alex: Have you? Great. OK, then we can go and see Paco Segovia. He plays flamenco guitar wonderfully! But it's expensive.  

Pam: Is it?  

Alex: Yes, £60 for two tickets but if I book online, they're cheaper.. Yes, look, they're £50 on the website. The concert starts at 8 p.m  

Pam: On Sunday morning at 11, there's a meeting about recycling in the neighbourhood. It’s in the Blue Bicycle Pub.  

Alex: Great! I want to book tickets for the dance festival on Sunday afternoon and then in the evening, I want to see a film.  

Pam: Do you? There are lots of good films on TV.  

Alex: Are there? I still want to go to the cinema...  

Pam: OK, no problem. Wonderful, then... We have plans for the weekend!
