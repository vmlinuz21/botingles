Presenter: What was the song that changed your life? On today's phone-in, we want you to phone and tell us about the songs that have been important in your lives. Our first caller is Holly. Hello, Holly.
Holly: Hi. Well, the song that changed my life was All My Love by Susie Hill. It's the type of song that I never used to listen to. It's a romantic soul song and I was crazy about rock and punk when I was young. But this was the song that was playing in the restaurant when my boyfriend said ‘Will you marry me?'. Now it's our song.
Presenter: Wow! How romantic. Thanks, Holly. Our next caller is Dan.
Dan: Hi. Right. er ... The band that I've always loved is Black Spirit. Do you know them?
Presenter: Of course, they're a hip hop band.
Dan: That's right. Well, one of their songs changed my life. It was called When We Were Young and I downloaded it and listened to it while I was studying for my university exams. It was the song that helped me study! And I passed all my exams!
Presenter: Well, good for you. Our last caller is Sophie. What's your song?
Sophie: Hi. I love all kinds of music - pop, rock, disco, but this song comes from the soundtrack of a musical. I'm really not interested in that type of music but it was on the radio on the day that I had an interview for a new job. The song is called Feeling Great. I felt great when I got to the interview and I got the job!
Presenter: OK. Thanks, Sophie. So, songs can change your life ...
