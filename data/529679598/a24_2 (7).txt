Hi, I'm Ed Hanson and today I'm talking about Edurne Pasabán. She was born in Tolosa in the Basque Country on 1 August 1973. Edurne climbs mountains - tall mountains! There are fourteen very tall mountains in the world - they are more than 8,000 metres. This group of mountains has a special name - 'eightthousanders'. When Edurne was 36, she became the 21st person and the first woman in history to climb all of the fourteen eightthousander mountains in the world.
She started climbing mountains when she was very young. When she was at school she went on holiday with her family to the Alps and climbed Mount Blanc. She was only sixteen. After that, she climbed more tall mountains in the Andes. In 2001 she climbed her first very tall mountain, her first eight-thousander. This mountain was Mount Everest.
Edurne is also an intelligent woman. She did a university degree in engineering. Her family have an engineering company in the Basque Country, but she doesn't work in this company. Edurne lived for some years in Barcelona, but then she returned to the Basque Country and opened a bed and breakfast and a restaurant. What next for Edurne?
