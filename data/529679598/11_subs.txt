Man: Hello and welcome to One World Radio. Today's programme is called 'One world, different lives'.

Woman: Fabio, Kala, and Dale are all from different countries.

Man: Fabio lives in Rome.

Woman: He's 20 and, like lots of young Italian men, he lives with his parents.

Man: At the moment, he's studying to be a doctor but he's also working in his father's bakery. Fabio, tell us about your day.

Fabio: My day is very long. I don't get a lot of sleep. I wake up at five o'clock and make bread. I work all day at university
as well. I go to bed at midnight. I don't really have a social life.

Man: Thank you, Fabio. Next, Kala. Kala is Canadian. She's 60, a retired nurse and she lives in Vancouver.

Woman: She's retired from nursing but right now, she's working in a bookshop.

Kala: I'm saving money for a holiday to Argentina. I sometimes work four hours a day; I start at ten o'clock in the morning. 
At the moment, I'm doing a Spanish course in my free time so I often work until about eleven o'clock in the evening. I enjoy my life.

Man: And finally, Dale. Dale is Jamaican, from Montego Bay.

Woman: He usually works about 360 days of the year.

Man: He works long hours to earn money. What are you doing at the moment, Dale?

Dale: At the moment, there are a lot of tourists here so I'm working as a taxi driver during the day and I'm doing nightshifts: some 
nights I work as a security guard for a local hotel. I often get up at six o'clock and go fishing two or three times a week. Right 
now, I'm driving to the market to sell my fish. I usually go to bed around ten o'clock when I don't have to work at the hotel. I have
got a busy life but a good life.
