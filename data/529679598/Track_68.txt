Paul: Oh, look at these jeans. Let's buy these for Bethany!
Liz: Paul, they're too expensive! What do you think of this sweatshirt?
Paul: It's quite tight! But she likes that. Also, it's a great colour and it's cheaper than the jeans.
Liz: OK, let's get the sweatshirt.
Paul: No, just a minute, what about these shorts? They're tighter than the jeans! Are they OK?
Liz: They're brilliant! OK, no to the jeans and the sweatshirt, let's buy the shorts.
Paul: Wait a minute. Do you like that waistcoat? And what about the red tights?
Liz: I love the waistcoat but it's a bit formal. The sweatshirt's more fashionable.
Paul: You're right.
Liz: The red tights are lovely ... but red doesn't suit her. Trust me Paul, black tights are better. Buy the black tights!
Paul: Do you like the black bra and knickers over there?
Liz: Yes, they're lovely but the white underwear's prettier. Let's not buy them. Oooh, I like this shirt. I know Bethany doesn't usually wear shirts but this one's quite loose and the shorts are tight. That's a great look!
Paul: Boots? Or sandals?
Liz: The black boots are just amazing. But boots are always expensive.
Paul: No, these are cheaper than the sandals because they're on sale. 40% off! Cool!
