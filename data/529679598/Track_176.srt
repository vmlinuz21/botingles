Fox hunting – for or against?

1 In 2004, the British Parliament voted to ban hunting with dogs in England and Wales. This stopped a traditional sport and a traditional way of life for thousands of people who live in the British countryside. A lot of people who live in cities are in favour of the ban, but a majority of people 
who live in the countryside don't want it. As a result, there is a lot of debate about fox hunting in Britain.

2 On the one hand, supporters of hunting say that foxes are a problem in the countryside and that they have to control them and kill them. Foxes kill chickens and other farm animals and have diseases which are bad for farm animals. On the other hand, opponents of fox hunting say that it is 
cruel and violent to hunt foxes with dogs. They agree that it is important to control the number of foxes. However, they think that people mustn’t use cruel, inhumane methods. 

3 The tradition of fox hunting started in Britain in the eighteenth century. When they are fox hunting, men and women wear red coats and black hats, and ride horses across the countryside. They follow a large pack of dogs – called foxhounds – which chase the fox and kill it. Since the introduction 
of the hunting ban, a lot of fox hunting has stopped. However, some traditional fox hunts continue. These days, they follow foxes across the countryside but they stop the dogs before they kill the fox. 

4 The ban on fox hunting continues to divide opinion in the UK. Although right-wing politicians and almost everyone who lives in the country are against the ban, left-wing politicians and people who live in the towns are in favour of it. It is a debate that is going to continue.
