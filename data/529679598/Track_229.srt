In Spain we celebrate lots of traditions and festivals. Every town or city has its local festivals to celebrate, for example, their patron saint’s day. These festivals are often celebrated in summer when people are on holiday. 
In Spanish celebrations people usually dance, play music, and eat and drink typical products. In the past there used to be a lot of festivals with animals, but it’s not as frequent now. That was cruel for the animals and often
 dangerous for people. However, we still have bullfights during important festivals like Sanfermines or Feria de Sevilla. For me, one of the most spectacular festivals is Fallas, in Valencia. There are bonfires all around the city
 to burn paper statues. Looking at the fire is an exciting experience, I think. You’ll enjoy it.
