Hello, Mona. I’m sorry you’re having problems with Nelly but I think I can help you. The other day, I heard some people on the radio talk about housework and the problem is that some people don’t share. 
When one person does all the housework, there are problems. For example, you cook very well, so you can do the cooking and the washing-up, and Nelly can do the dusting, make the beds and do the ironing. 
Then, you can walk the dog together! It can be a good moment to talk and relax. What do you think?
