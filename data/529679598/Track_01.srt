Today, we've all got busy lives. We work a lot and we haven't got a lot of free time. But some people have the time to work, rest and play. What's the secret?

Professor Gabriel Hinds is a sociologist and he's studying the effect of lifestyle on health. 'Nowadays, many people feel unhappy. Their lives are boring or they 
feel stressed. They do the same things every day but they don't know how to change. I want to find out how people can make changes to have a better life and be relaxed.' 

Professor Hinds uses a questionnaire to find out about people's lifestyles. Why don't you try it?
