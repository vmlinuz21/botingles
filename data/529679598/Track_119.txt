Mark: How's life in your house share, Susie? Are you enjoying it?
Susie: Yes, I am, actually. It's fun, most of the time. But living with three other girls isn't always easy. We've had to make some strict rules. 
Mark: Really?
Susie: Yes. For example, one rule is that we mustn't go out if we haven't washed the dishes. Oh, and we mustn't use the washing machine on Sundays. It's noisy and the girls want to study. What about you? Are you enjoying living in your hall of residence?
Mark: Well, yes. It's easy living there. There's a kitchen, so I can cook, but only when I want to. They give us breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hall of residence. And, of course, I don't do any cleaning or tidying. They clean my room every day. It's great.
Susie: Lucky you. I have to clean and tidy all the time. But aren't there a lot of rules?
Mark: Well, yes, there are. We mustn't invite friends to stay, for example, and we mustn't play musical instruments in our rooms because it's noisy! I have to go to the music room to practise my guitar.
Susie: Oh no, too many rules for me. I prefer living with friends.
Mark: Well, I like being in hall. I have more free time because I don't have to wash, clean and tidy like you!
