Home working – the end of nine-to-five office hours? 

Working from home has become very popular nowadays. However, it has good points and bad points. Here we talk to some home workers who tell us what they like and don’t like about home working.

Phil Shaw 
I have worked from home since I started my new job last year. Friends have asked me if I feel isolated. But I haven't felt lonely because we have online meetings every day and I have been to the pub with a few colleagues. In summer, the company is going to have a big picnic in a park.

Ed Meek 
There are some things I don't like about home working. I don't like using my own electricity, for example, and I think the company should pay some of my bills. I have written to my boss but she hasn't replied. Also, the chair I use has given me a bad back. However, I enjoy going to the 
shops during the day when there aren’t so many people.

Home working is perfect for me because I use a wheelchair, so now I don't spend hours on public transport. I have a busy work timetable and two children, so my work has become more organised now. Colleagues have visited for 'coffee meetings' and we've chatted about everything, not 
just work.

I have started to work from home three days a week and I love it. I needed to save money and now I save 30 pounds a week. I have spent this extra money on a new bike and I plan to redecorate my flat. I feel more relaxed and Diva and Susie, my dogs, are happy because they have more walks.
