Conversation 1 
Phil: Hi Lorraine, what are you doing on Friday? 
Lorraine: Nothing, why? 
Phil: Do you want to see Carmen with Timandra and I? It's an amazing show – the actors sing more beautifully than in any other opera I've ever seen. Actually, it's a dress rehearsal and they sell fewer tickets, so we can watch it more calmly than usual. What do you think? 
Lorraine: Ok, great! 

Conversation 2 
Lorraine: Hi Phil, sorry, I said 'yes' faster than I should – have you bought the tickets? Would you mind if we saw Cabaret? It's more dramatically interesting than Carmen in my opinion, and there's also some great singing, and you like musicals. 
Phil: I'll ask Timandra, wait a minute... 

Conversation 3 
Phil: Hi Lorraine, look, Timandra wants to see Carmen now because her pupils are doing a version of the opera at school and she wants to get ideas for dance steps. She has heard that this company dance more artistically than many others. What do you think? Sorry, I know we 
are not behaving as flexibly as usual, but maybe we could see Cabaret next month?
