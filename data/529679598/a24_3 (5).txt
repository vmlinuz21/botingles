Peter: I'm lucky. I'm good at languages. I understand words quickly and I can learn pronunciation easily but I always have my dictionary with me. I find examples of words and how to use them.
Lauren: I love learning Spanish. I don't know a lot of Spanish grammar and vocabulary but I can get by. I make mistakes but it's not a problem. I try to read Spanish books and magazines.
Peter: In class, my teacher is a quiet speaker. I often say 'Could you speak up a bit, please?'
Lauren: I'm not worried about making mistakes. I often don't understand people. I just say 'Sorry, I can't understand.' It's easy. It's never a problem.
Peter: My teachers often speak and I don't understand. But I don't worry. I say 'Could you say that again, please?' I sometimes write new words and phrases in my notebook.
Lauren: I carry an iPad. I have a list of new words. I write them down in a sentence as an example and then write the definition next to them. My teacher often speaks fast. I say 'Could you speak more slowly?' or 'Could you say that again?'.
