Chris: OK, Danny, you need clothes for a dinner party, right?
Danny: Well, yes but it's a dinner party with my boss and the company director.
Chris: So, it's formal. Do you want to wear a suit - trousers and a jacket?
Danny: I'm not sure. My boss is more informal. He usually wears jeans and a jacket.
Chris: No problem. What about these jeans? They're a designer label and they fit.
Danny: Nice! They are the best jeans in the shop. What about a sweatshirt?
Chris: Oh, no! You need a shirt. Jeans are more informal so a good shirt makes you look smarter and just a bit more formal.
Danny: I see. Jeans, shirt ...
Chris: Yes, and a waistcoat. What about this one?
Danny: What a great waistcoat! I love it. And shoes. Or what about boots?
Chris: Let me see. Shoes are better than boots because they're more formal. Look, these are lovely.
