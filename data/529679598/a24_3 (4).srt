Tonight's TV: 'The Language Question' 

The programme interviews two experts on language learning. The experts use methods and techniques with two classes of learners for six weeks. Then, they compare their results. These are some of the experts' ideas. 

Miguel Tamar
'I'm a businessman and my business is communication. I can speak 12 languages and my method is simple. Learning languages is easy and natural. Learners should relax and enjoy learning.' 

Naomi Champney 
'Learning languages is natural: we do it when we're babies. But when you learn a language as an adult, it's complicated and sometimes boring to learn vocabulary and study grammar.'

Miguel Tamar
'You need to learn the grammar and then practise listening and speaking. My learners use my online platform. They listen and make notes in the language they are learning; they shouldn't translate new words. Then they practise speaking! We all need to pronounce words correctly.'

Naomi Champney 
'I use textbooks, grammar books and a dictionary. We sometimes use computers but I prefer using notebooks because when learners write words on paper, they remember the words. You need to use all four skills. We practise reading, writing, listening and speaking. We revise language every lesson.'

And guess which group of learners made the most progress ... Sorry, you need to watch the programme: 9 p.m. BTV4.
