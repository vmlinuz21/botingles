Naomi: Hello, Naomi Clough.
Edwin: Hello, it's me!
Naomi: Hello, Ed. How are you?
Edwin: I'm OK. I'm sitting in front of my computer. Where are you?
Naomi: I'm sitting on the train. Are you at home?
Edwin: Yes. Are you coming home?
Naomi: No, sorry, it's Thursday night. I always go to my book club on Thursdays.
Edwin: Oh, your book club! But I'm cooking dinner at the moment. It's chicken and I know you love chicken.
Naomi: I'm sorry, but Saba's usually at book club and I want to talk to her. She's having a difficult time at work.
Edwin: I see. OK, no problem. Saba's a good friend. See you later. What time?
Naomi: Book club never finishes late.
Edwin: You usually talk until midnight! OK, remember tomorrow's Friday and you usually go to work early on Fridays.
Naomi: I know! Oh, I can't talk any more, the train's stopping. See you later. What's that noise?
Edwin: I'm opening a bottle of wine! See you later.
