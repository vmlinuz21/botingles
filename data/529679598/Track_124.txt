Jenny: I've changed and my life has changed so much in the past ten years. It's amazing to think about it. I used to have very long hair. Now, it's short! I'm not the same height. I was short then and I'm tall now. And ten years ago, I used to live with my parents in the country, and now I have this really cool flat in the city. Ten years ago, I used to hang out with my school friends all the time, but I never see them now. Of course, I'm still with Ben. He was my boyfriend back then and we've stayed together. Perhaps the biggest change of all is that I'm now a working girl. I used to hate studying when I was at school all those years ago. But I just love working in an office!
