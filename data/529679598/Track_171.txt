NATIONAL TRADITIONS
1
Scotland's national poet Robert Burns was born on 25th January 1759 in the small Scottish town of Alloway, and died on 21st July 1796 at the age of 37. He was someone who made a tremendous impression on many people in Scotland during his lifetime. In July 1801, a group of his friends decided to celebrate his life and his poetry with a supper. At the supper, they ate haggis, which is a typical Scottish food made from sheep's meat and onions. They also drank whisky and read some of Burns poems. It began a tradition of Burns Suppers, which are popular with Scottish people all over the world. Nowadays, however, the suppers usually take place on or around 25th January, and it is called 'Burns Night'.

The Melbourne Cup is Australia's most popular horse race. It is an annual event which 'stops' the nation. Since the race began in 1861, it has always taken place on the first Tuesday in November, and it is so important to the Australian people that it is a public holiday in the city of Melbourne and the state of Victoria. There isn't anyone in the country who doesn't watch it, and most people place a bet on the race.

Saint Patrick is someone that we don't know very well. In fact, we don't know anything about his childhood. However, historical documents show that he lived in Ireland in the late fifth century, and that he died on March 17th. So that is the day when we celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. It is not only a religious festival. It is a celebration of Irish culture. People wear green and there are parades and festivals of music and culture all over Ireland, and anywhere else in the world that has a large population of people with Irish heritage.
