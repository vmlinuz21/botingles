Interviewer: What type of music are you interested in, Ronnie?
Ronnie: Well, pop and rock are the types of music that most people like these days. But I don't. I love jazz. It's an exciting type of music which I really like. I don't want to hear all that romantic, commercial pop music.
Interviewer: OK. And who's your favourite musician?
Ronnie: Well, it's Charlie Parker. He was a great saxophonist. He's a musician who I've always loved.
Interviewer: And do you play an instrument?
Ronnie: Well, yes, sure.
Interviewer: Oh, what instrument do you play? The saxophone?
Ronnie: Oh no. It's an instrument that I've never learned. It's very difficult. I'm a pianist. I play in a group called The Crazy Birds. There's a drummer and a guitarist in the band - and me, of course.
Interviewer: Do you often go to concerts?
Ronnie: Oh yes, I go quite often. I probably see one concert every four weeks. Of course, I'm often busy with my band.
Interviewer: What was the last concert that you went to?
Ronnie: Oh, I saw a band called Fiona and the Fashions last Saturday. It wasn't jazz. They played soul music and were very good. They're a band that I'd recommend.
