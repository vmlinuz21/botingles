Some people have done amazing things in their lives. Do you know these famous people and what they have achieved in their careers? Here you can learn about some things they are not so famous for.

1 We love Ferran Adrià's food, of course, but he hasn't always been a chef. He's had a job as a dishwasher, for example. More recently, he's taught at Harvard University in the USA and he's written many books. He's also been a cook in the Spanish army.

2 Ranulph Fiennes, one of the world's greatest adventurers, has also been in the army. He worked in the British army for eight years. As an adventurer, he's walked across the Antarctica, he's run seven marathons in seven days on seven continents, and he's 
been to the top of Mount Everest. He's written many books about his expeditions.

3 Teresa Perales has never competed in the Olympic Games but she has swum in the Paralympics and she has won many medals in her long career, including one silver medal at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics with a serious shoulder injury! What you may not 
know is that she has also served as a politician and taught at a university. She has also written her autobiography and helped many charities. She has travelled to India to meet poor Indian women with disabilities and has even invented a special chair to 
help disabled people living in the desert go to the toilet.

4 You've probably seen Penélope Cruz in many great films, but did you know that she has done a lot of work for charity? One amazing thing she has done is to work for Mother Teresa in India. Another interesting thing about Penélope is that she has appeared 
in a music video. It was for the pop group Mecano!
