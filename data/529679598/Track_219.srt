Different pay in different places? Teachers angry about pay changes

Teachers' unions are furious about government suggestions that teachers' pay and working conditions need to change.

The Prime Minister is in favour of the proposals. 'In the past, public sector workers, that is, people who are employed by the government (teachers, for example) were paid the same if they worked in Newcastle or Brighton. Only public sector workers in London 
were paid extra, because the cost of living in the capital is very high.'

The Minister for Education added, ‘The system needs some changes so that it's fairer for public sector workers, employed by the government and private sector workers, employed by private businesses.’ 

Teachers' unions are angry. They point out that teachers' pay was frozen by the government two years ago and that because public workers' salary is decided by unions and the government nationally, everyone should have the same pay, except for London teachers. 

The leader of the largest teachers' union thinks the plans are unfair. 'Our education system is at risk. It's important that our children are taught by good teachers and good teachers are upset by these suggestions.'
