Paul: Hello and welcome back to the Paul Oldman Show. Callers are ringing and telling me about their favourite adverts. And we have a lot of callers. Pam's on line 3. Hello Pam.
Pam: Oh, hello, am I on the radio?
Paul: Yes, Pam, you are. What's your favourite advert, Pam?
Pam: Oh, well, I like that one for the chocolates, you know. What are they called? Black Gold Chocolates, that's it. In the advert, there's an attractive man. He's wearing a suit and he's ... well, you know, James Bond. He climbs mountains and swims across the sea to give the chocolates to a beautiful woman. And she's so happy when he arrives that she kisses him. I like adverts with a bit of adventure, a story, you don't know what's going to happen ...
Paul: Oh, well I love that advert, too. Thanks for your call Pam. Now, Tom's on line 2. What type of advert do you like, Tom?
Tom: Well, I'm not interested in exciting or romantic ads. I like really funny commercials.
Paul: I know what you mean. The advert for the sports car, for example? When it goes under the sea.
Tom: Oh no, not that one. I don't think that's funny. The one I like is the advert for the family car, you know, what's the car called, the Yazz. With a Y. The car's so big that twenty children get into it!
Paul: Oh, right, yes, I know that one. OK. Sarah's on line 3. What's your favourite type of advert?
Sarah: Hi Paul. er ... well, I don't like funny or frightening adverts. If I watch commercials, I always enjoy the ones that are different. For example, there's the advert for that mobile phone. You know the one. The Supersound 34. Yes, that's it. The Supersound 34. The advert is so unusual that I didn't know what they were advertising when I watched it for the first time ...
