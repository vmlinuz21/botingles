Tabby: Hi, Harvey, How are you? I haven't seen you for ages!
Harvey: I know! It's lovely to see you. How are you?
Tabby: Very well, thanks. I've just got a new job, so I'm very busy.
Harvey: That's great! What's the job?
Tabby: I'm the manager of a travel agency. How about you? What's new in your life?
Harvey: Well, I got married. To Marianne - a lovely woman.
Tabby: Really? Congratulations!
Harvey: And then I got divorced!
Tabby: Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
Harvey: Yes, I think it was the shortest marriage in history. And my divorce was faster than a racing car! She was very rich. Marianne and I are still friends.
Tabby: Oh, great!
Harvey: Yes, she helped me start my own computer business. And we bought a new flat together and I'm still living there. And - the best of all - she found me a new girlfriend!
Tabby: Wow! She's the best ex-wife in the world!
