YOUR SCORES

More than 24 points. You must change your life! You often get a cough or a throat infection. Do some exercise and eat healthy food. Give up your unhealthy habits: no tobacco or alcohol. If you are stressed, try some alternative therapies. Yoga, acupuncture or hypnosis can help you relax. 

Between 11 and 23 points. You are healthy in some ways but not in others. Think about your health and diet. You must do more exercise and eat healthy food. Alcohol can give you a headache – try water! You also have to reduce your working hours.

Between 0 and 10 points. Well done! You have a healthy lifestyle, so you don't need to change the way you live. You probably feel well and when you get ill, you are probably not ill for a long time.
