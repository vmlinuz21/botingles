When I was 15 ...

I hated being 15. I think I was a difficult teenager. I used to get up late and I never wanted to go to school. At weekends, I used to sit in my room playing computer games or talking to my friends online. I used to argue with my parents all the time. In fact, I was quite rebellious. Nowadays, it's so different. I still live at home but I am good friends with my mum and dad. They know I'm responsible and they trust me.

When I was young, teenagers weren't as independent as they are now. My mum and dad were very strict and they were angry when I got up late or I didn't do my homework. My brother and I never used to go out in the evenings. We were never rude; in fact, we were really well-behaved. At the weekend, we used to do housework and help mum with the shopping. Of course, we didn't have computers, phones or TVs in those days, so we used to play outside in the street with our friends.

I used to be cool! Well, I thought I was cool when I was 15. I used to play football and basketball all the time and I had a lot of friends. We used to hang out in the shopping centre at weekends. I lived with my mum. She was nice, but she wasn't strict. I never did any homework. Once, I stole a newspaper from a shop and a policeman came to our house. My mum used to talk about things with me but I didn't use to listen to her. Now, I'm married with two teenage children. I know how difficult it is to talk to teenagers!
