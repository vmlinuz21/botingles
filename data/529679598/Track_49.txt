Lydia: Hello, Doctor North.
Doctor: Hello, Mrs Prescott. Please, come in and sit down.
Lydia: Thank you.
Doctor: Now, what's the matter?
Lydia: I just don't feel very well. I have a headache all the time. I'm always sneezing.
Doctor: Have you got any other symptoms? Sore throat? Neck or back pain?
Lydia: My back hurts sometimes. And I often have a high temperature. I'm worried, doctor.
Doctor: Well, do you smoke and do you drink alcohol?
Lydia: Yes, I smoke about ten cigarettes a day. I'm trying to stop but I can't. And I usually have one or two glasses of wine in the evenings.
Doctor: How do you feel about your life, Mrs Prescott? You know, your job, family and so on.
Lydia: My family are great but my job's very stressful at the moment.
Doctor: Do you sleep well?
Lydia: No, not really. I often can't sleep. What should I do?
Doctor: First, no cigarettes. I think you should try alternative medicine, you know, like hypnosis. Also, you shouldn't drink alcohol during the week. Only drink one or two glasses of wine at the weekend. Your job is stressful and I think you are feeling depressed. I can give you some painkillers for your headache but you should take a week off work. I also think you must get more exercise. Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables ... ?
