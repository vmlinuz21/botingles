Mimi: Hi Rod, it's Mimi, where are you?
Rod:  I'm sitting on a train at the moment. I'm going home from work. What are you doing?
Mimi: I'm drinking a coffee and I'm texting my friends. Well, and now I'm talking to you.
Rod:  OK, well, right now, I'm eating a sandwich. It isn't a good sandwich! By the way, where are you?
Mimi: At the moment, I'm staying in a hotel in Cambridge.
Rod:  Cambridge? What's the weather like today? Is the sun shining?
Mimi: No, it's raining! Do you like Cambridge?
Rod:  Yes, I love Cambridge. I often have dinner at the Café Rouge on Kings Street. Do you eat there?
Mimi: Yes, sometimes.
Rod:  Right. What do you usually do in Cambridge?
Mimi: I always stay in the same hotel. It's called the Western Hotel and it's in the centre of town. I usually visit the university and I always go shopping. What are you doing?
Rod:  Right now, I'm emailing my friend Helena in Cambridge. Do you want to meet her for a coffee?
Mimi: Thanks, Rod! That's great.
