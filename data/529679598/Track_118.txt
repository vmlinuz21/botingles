Jeanette: Do you remember the 1980s, Barry?
Barry: Of course I do. I was in my twenties then.
Jeanette: Do you remember the clothes we used to wear?
Barry: Oh, yes. I used to have very tight jeans and I had a white jacket with big shoulders. I wanted to be an American TV detective.
Jeanette: Oh, I remember that fashion. I used to wear very short skirts - miniskirts. And my hair! It was blonde then and I had a crazy hairstyle. I wanted to be Madonna. Pop bands in those days wore amazing clothes.
Barry: Absolutely. But their songs were fun. Boy George, Duran Duran, Madonna ... I loved their sounds. I still do.
Jeanette: Me too. I used to have a big poster of Boy George on my wall. He was my favourite pop star.
Barry: Where did you use to go to in the evenings? Which places did you like?
Jeanette: Oh, let me see. My friends and I used to get dressed up and go to the Peppermint Club on Saturday night. That was a cool place in those days. Do you remember it?
Barry: Yes, I do. I never went there. I think it closed down years ago. Things have changed a lot, haven't they? The 80s seem long, long ago now.
