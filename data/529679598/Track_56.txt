Jess: Evie, can you do something for me?
Evie: What's that, Jess?
Jess: Can you do the hoovering in your room this week, please?
Evie: Really? Is it untidy?
Jess: It's really untidy, Evie. There are clothes on the floor and on the chairs. You have to do your washing every week. Of course, you don't have to do the ironing.
Evie: Oh, right. Thanks.
Jess: And talking of the kitchen, please don't leave your dirty dishes on the kitchen table. After you cook a meal, you have to do the washing-up. I don't want to come home and have to do your washing-up before I make my meal. Don't leave it for me.
Evie: OK.
Jess: And after you have a bath or shower, can you clean the bathroom, please? It's OK if I have to clean up sometimes, but not all the time. I'm not your mother. OK?
Evie: OK. Sorry, Jess.
