Martin: Well, I come from a religious family so we always go to church after breakfast on this day. Back at home, we give chocolate eggs to the children and sometimes we play games in the garden if the weather is nice. We put some eggs in the garden and the children have to find them. We cook a special dinner in the evening with roast lamb and cake.

Jenny: Oh, I usually buy a card for my boyfriend, and send it to him. He always gives me chocolates and a card with a poem in it. In the evening, we sometimes have a romantic dinner in a nice restaurant.

Adam: Well, it's often cold at this time of year but we always go to watch a fire and fireworks. It's a really interesting English festival. We eat baked potatoes that we cook in the fire and toffee apples. I enjoy it - the fireworks are the most exciting thing.

Sue: You don't have this festival in europe. It's special for us because of its history, and it's a family occasion. We travel to my parents' house in Connecticut and eat a lot of food. We always have roast turkey. It's a really nice day because I see all my family.
