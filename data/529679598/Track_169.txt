Milo: Hi Dawn! How are you?
Dawn: Oh, hi, Milo. Not bad, but I'm really fed up with my new neighbours. They're as rude as your neighbour, Mr Pipstock!
Milo: Oh, dear. Well we all know about him. I'm always as friendly as I can be to him, but he's so moody!
Dawn: I know. But at least he isn't noisy.
Milo: No, that's true. He's as quiet as a mouse. Are your new neighbours noisy then?
Dawn: Well, they're less noisy than the old neighbours, but they're not exactly quiet!
Milo: Did you help them move in?
Dawn: Yes. I was as helpful as possible, and they were still rude.
Milo: Well, try to be patient. Maybe they are just shy.
Dawn: I do try, but I'm less tolerant than you.
