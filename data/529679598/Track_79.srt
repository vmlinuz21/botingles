Out with the old, in with the new 

It's nearly New Year's Eve and right now, all over the country, people are making resolutions. They want to give up smoking. They want to stop biting their fingernails. They are planning to do more exercise. The problem with so many New Year's resolutions is that 
we make them, but a few days later we forget all about them. The best advice we can give is to choose resolutions that are important to you, and not impossible to keep! So, to inspire you, here are some resolutions the people in the Choices office are making this year. 
Suzanne Barnes, our fashion editor: 

‘I'm going to save money. I spend too much on clothes and eating out. I'm going to stay at home more and only buy clothes when I need them! Then maybe one day I can buy my own house.’ 

Meanwhile, John Botten, our production manager, says he is going to do more housework. 

‘My wife usually does most of the housework, but now we have a new baby. I'm going to do all the hoovering and cleaning, and at the weekends I'm going to do the washing and the ironing.’ 

Our art editor, Rachel Short, is going to get fit.

 ‘I'm going to join a health club, and I'm going to walk to work.’

Finally, Simon Harper, designer, says, 

‘I'm going to learn a new language, and spend less time watching TV. I'm going to do more exercise and stop eating fast food.’ 

Well, good luck with your New Year's resolutions!
