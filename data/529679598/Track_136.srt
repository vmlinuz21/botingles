Hi, Grandad. Sam here. Did you know I'm studying advertising at university? It's a wonderful course. When I visit you at Christmas, I'll tell you all about it. Anyway, last week I entered a competition to write a radio jingle for a new backache tablet called Painaway. You know, a jingle ... 
a slogan with music, like a little song. 
It's difficult, but if I win the competition, I'll take a trip to New York with the prize-money. I really want to go there. In fact, I think, when I graduate, I'll try to get a job there. New York is the centre of global advertising and if you’re successful there, you’ll be successful anywhere…, as 
someone once sang... Anyway, the radio jingle should be exactly six seconds long. I think my slogan is simple but effective: When I feel ill, I'll take this pill: Painaway, wave goodbye to backache fast. Do you like it? If the pill company don't like the jingle, I'll try to write a better one. Keep 
your fingers crossed for me! Speak soon!
