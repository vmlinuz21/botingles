Martin: Hello, ladies and gentleman. Thanks for coming to the advertising meeting for our exciting new product. The product, of course, is Snappies. Right. Well, we want a really interesting slogan to advertise the product. I have a few ideas and I'd like to share them with you ... My first idea for a slogan is ... If your kids like chocolate, they'll love Snappies ... What do you think, Jack?
Jack: Ummm, well it's a bit boring really, I mean most kids like chocolate. I think we need something more modern with a really good jingle that people can remember. What do you think, Julia?
Julia: Yeah, I agree. Have you got any other ideas, Martin?
Martin: OK ... My second idea is ... Kids will eat their breakfast if you give them Snappies ... er ... Right ... How about ... You won't be hungry in the morning if you eat Snappies with milk ... No?... er ... OK then ... Well, if you have a better idea, I'll listen. But remember, this is very important. If people like our slogan, we'll sell millions.
