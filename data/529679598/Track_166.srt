The Art of Small Talk

Small talk or the ability to talk about nothing is particularly important when we want to get on with our neighbours. Small talk helps us to be friendly to our neighbours, but at the same time to keep our distance. We want to keep our lives private, and we don't want to be rude. 
Small talk is talking about unimportant general topics, not personal things. But sometimes that's not easy! Some people are natural 'small talkers'. They find it easy to talk about nothing. Other people find it more difficult. 

So what topics can we discuss with our neighbours? One of the most popular topics of conversation is probably the weather. 'Beautiful day today, isn't it?' 'Yes, it is. Better than yesterday.' The news is also a very common topic. Men, in particular, like to talk about sports news, 
especially if it is about a local team or player. 'Did you see the football on TV last night?' 'Yes, great match, wasn't it?' It's also OK to talk about local news that affects you and your neighbours. Did you hear about the new train station?' Yes, isn't it fantastic?' You should be 
careful with some topics, like religion and politics. You don't want to offend your neighbours. 

In England people don't normally talk about their salaries, or personal topics like divorce or their age. One of the easiest ways to start a conversation is to say something nice about their hair or their clothes. 'What a beautiful coat, Mrs Jones.' 'Oh, thank you. Do you like it? It's 
new.' This is always a good way to make your neighbour feel happy and cheerful! So, small talk is definitely useful to live in harmony with our neighbours!
