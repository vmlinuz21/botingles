Jo: I don't understand why you like this sport, Simon. It's so violent.
Simon: Well, yes, it is. But it's also very exciting. And it's very traditional. People have done it for hundreds of years.
Jo: Yes. But it's a dangerous sport. Somebody tries to hurt somebody else.
Simon: True. But I like it because it's about two men - one on one. They can only use their hands to win.

Tim: Personally, I oppose it because it's violent. What do you think, Katy?
Katy: Well, I agree with you. I think it's cruel. OK. It's part of the culture in some parts of England and Scotland and in other countries. But I don't know if it is legal.
Tim: I don't know. But it is very cruel ...

Louise: In my opinion, we don't need this sport. I can't believe that people go into the countryside and kill animals with dogs or guns. It's very cruel.
Mark: I don't think so. It's traditional and natural. In nature, animals die in violent ways. I don't think it is cruel to kill animals.
