Week 4
Only two weeks of our adventure to go. This week we're travelling through Australia's 'Red Centre'. We're visiting the town of Alice Springs, or as the local people call it, 'The Alice'. Right now, as I'm writing, I'm looking out of the window at a family of kangaroos. I think they are searching for food.
David is visiting one of the local tourist attractions, the MacDonnell National Park. Right now, I think he's sitting under a tree and drinking traditional Australian 'billy tea'.
The other people at the hostel are from all over the world. Right now, some of them are eating lunch but I can't eat at lunchtime ... it's too hot! I eat in the evening when it's cool. The chef does a good barbecue. I think barbecue is their national dish!
There are a lot of Aboriginal families in and around 'The Alice'. They make money in different ways. Today, one guy is telling stories to travellers and he's painting amazing pictures of birds and animals.
The landscape is unique. I can only see red desert but plants and animals grow and live here in the heat. Today, as usual, the sun is shining and here in 'The Red Centre Hostel' the air-conditioning is working all the time. The temperature is 45 degrees Celsius so I'm staying indoors and drinking cold water!
