Hi, my name's Martin Boyle. I'm going to tell you a little bit about my life.
I was married once, but I got divorced in 2003. Now I've got a new partner. We met on holiday in Ibiza in 2006.
I haven't got any children, but Kelly has got a son from her first marriage.
I left university in 1997 with a degree in sociology. I couldn't find a job so I learned to drive a bus. I got my bus driving licence in 2000. I started to work as a bus driver the same year. I also like writing. I began my first book in 2002 and finished it in 2007.
The book sold 1,000 copies in 2007-8. I wrote three more books between 2008 and 2011. All three books have sold 8,000 copies.
I started collecting stamps when I was 10. I still collect them.
Kelly thinks I'm mad but she likes salsa dancing and I think that's crazy!
I have never been to the USA and I've never won a prize in my life. 
My dream is to be a famous writer and write a best-seller.
