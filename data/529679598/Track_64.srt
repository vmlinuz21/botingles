Shopping is a man thing 

Some men hate the idea of shopping for clothes, especially on Saturday afternoons when there's sport on TV! But one man loves shopping. He's Scott Gasper, personal shopper. Shopping is his job! He goes shopping every day and he loves it. We spoke to Scott about his passion for shopping.

My most important client is Ryan Norris. He's a top businessman and he's too busy to go shopping. He's married and has two daughters. He has to wear formal clothes for work, so I buy him a lot of dark suits. His daughters like classic designs with high-heeled shoes. I usually buy them casual, 
fashionable dresses and his daughters look great. 

I have also got a very interesting client called Chuck Jackson. He's a doctor and he works a lot. He hates shopping so I choose all his clothes. He always wears a suit and a waistcoat. He's a tall, slim guy and so he always looks amazing in a suit and a classic raincoat. 

Another interesting client is called Peter Scotland, a film director. He's small but he usually buys medium or large shirts and they're too big for him! He often goes to celebrity events but he prefers casual clothes. He never knows what size or colours to buy. I usually buy him a variety of clothes, 
for example blue, green or pink shirts, and he chooses the ones he likes. He looks good in different colours. 

Clarke Adams is one of my favourite clients. He's a lawyer and he can't find clothes to fit (he's an extra small). I buy a lot of his clothes online. He always asks me to buy presents for his girlfriend, as he hates going into women's clothes shops. I buy all her underwear: bras, knickers and even slippers!
