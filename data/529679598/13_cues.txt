3.870	8.880	Are you a student from St James's School, Manchester, 1980s?
9.990	12.420	I'm organising a school reunion! Do you remember me? I'm Paul 'Scotty' Scott and I went to St James's School from 1981–1986. Were you
13.290	14.430	in my class? Our teacher was Mrs King. I talked a lot and I didn't do any work, so I didn't pass my exams. [...] I am looking for people
14.880	17.100	from my class, and I really want to find Harry Kelly. We met on the first day of school but he moved to London. Come to the reunion,
17.400	21.090	Harry!
21.450	23.010	Were you in the County Hospital, Cambridge, 18 years ago?
23.850	25.650	18 years ago, I had my first baby, a beautiful daughter, Octavia. She was born in the County Hospital, Cambridge. I didn't sleep a lot
26.640	27.480	and for 10 days the nurses and doctors looked after Octavia. They were very kind, but I can't remember their names. [...] Octavia had
27.750	28.860	her 18th birthday last week and I want to say 'Thank you!'
29.820	32.580	Did you work in the Railway Hotel, Oxford, between 1920 and 1970?
32.850	35.040	My name is Pauline Thomas and I'm writing a history of the Railway Hotel in Oxford. My father died in 1956, when I was very young.
38.340	41.100	I first visited the hotel with my mother in 1957. She went there with my father in 1932. I went to Oxford last year, to walk around
41.400	44.460	the city. It was very romantic. I want to find stories about the hotel for my book. [...] Thank you for your help.
