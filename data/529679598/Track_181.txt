Presenter: Hello and welcome to Festivities. I'm talking to Andy Stewart about Hogmanay. What exactly is Hogmanay, Andy?
Andy: Well, Hogmanay is a very old Scottish word and we don't really know what it means. But the Hogmanay festival is the same as New Year's eve in england and Wales. However, in Scotland, it is a more important time and we have more New Year traditions than in england.
Presenter: So, what exactly do people do at Hogmanay?
Andy: Well, in Scotland's towns and cities, people usually have parties at home with family and friends. They sing and dance, and at midnight, at the end of the year, everybody holds hands and sings a very traditional song.
Presenter: Auld Lang Syne?
Andy: That's right. Auld Lang Syne. It's a very old song about remembering friends and we only sing it at midnight on Hogmanay. After midnight, some Scottish people then visit their neighbours' houses. They walk out into the cold weather. This is called first-footing. They take coal or fruit cake or whisky. It is good luck to be the first person to visit a house. And it is good luck if the first person who visits your house is a tall, dark man!
Presenter: Really? Is it different in the north of Scotland?
Andy: Well, no. They have the same traditions. However, sometimes they also have bonfires and fire festivals.
Presenter: OK. Well, thanks for telling us about Hogmanay, Andy.
