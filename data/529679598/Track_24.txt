Albert: 
I remember, I went with my dad to watch an international football match between England and Brazil. England lost so I felt quite annoyed. After the match, we met this guy. We talked for a while and then I realised it was Pelé, the most famous footballer in the world! I felt nervous at first but he was very polite and friendly and after a few minutes he made me feel really relaxed. He was a star but also a person, like me and my dad.

Lisa: 
I remember May 2nd, 1997. I was on a school trip to France. We stopped on the motorway to eat lunch. One of the boys in my class, Andrew Bell, offered me a cigarette. I was only 12! I felt confused. I didn't want a cigarette but I wanted to be cool, like Andrew. So, anyway, I took a cigarette and smoked it and then I was sick on the bus. I felt really foolish!

David: 
I remember that I went to a school disco. There was a girl there. Her name was Sarah. One of her friends asked me if I liked her. I said I did but I didn't really. We danced together and I felt really uncomfortable. I didn't like her and I didn't want to dance with her. And then she just kissed me! I was so surprised I didn't know what to do, I just stood there, like a tree! She was really angry. It wasn't a long relationship!
