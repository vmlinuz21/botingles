The truth about advertising
We showed three advertisements to advertising manager Oliver Clarke, and we asked him a question: How are the advertisements trying to sell the products?

1
A lot of companies use celebrities in their advertising campaigns. In this advert, a drinks company is using a famous, young film star. The message is clear. If you want to be beautiful, popular and cool, drink this product! The problem for companies is that they have to choose the celebrity very carefully. If consumers like the celebrity, they'll buy the product. But, of course, if they don't like the celebrity, they'll probably choose a different product.

2
Everybody wants to feel good. That's why you see a lot of attractive, smiling people in advertisements and TV commercials. If a travel company is selling holidays, the advertisement shows a romantic couple in a beautiful, sunny place. If they want to sell breakfast cereal, advertisers show a happy family at breakfast time. This advert is telling parents that their children will love them if they buy this product.

3
Advertisements often have slogans, and TV or radio commercials often use catchy pop songs, and that's because songs are a good way to sell products. If you can't stop singing a song about a product, you won't forget its name. And, of course, if you know the name of the product, you'll buy it. In this advert, the slogan is really memorable. You'll remember it when you are in the supermarket.
