Nigel & Sue 

'I remember that Sue and I argued a lot. Sometimes we argued for days. It was always about the same things: money, work, time. She felt depressed and was often angry and I was bored.  … . ' 

These are the words of Nigel Haven. Nigel worked in the City of London, in a large bank, for 15 years. He met his wife, Sue, there. 'We were very unhappy.  … . I wanted a big house but Nigel thought our house was big. I wanted new furniture or new clothes. Nigel and I worked for about fourteen hours 
a day. I never saw him.' Nigel explains what they decided to do. 'We went on holiday for a couple of days. We went for a long walk and we talked about what was important to us. I think we both felt a bit foolish at first but (C) … and really started to say how we felt.' 

Sue takes up the story. ' … but when we got back to our hotel, we felt great. You know, excited and happy. After dinner, we sat down for twenty minutes and we wrote a list of the things we wanted from our lives.' 
Nigel laughs and continues. 'We realised that we had money, a big house, good jobs and all those things but  … we didn't do the things we enjoyed doing.' 

Sue's turn. 'I went on a website and found a house on an island in the north-west of Scotland. We jumped into our car, drove for five hours, took one look at the house and Nigel decided to buy it.  … 

Nigel again. 'We gave up our busy London lives and this is where we live now. We walk every day. I grow vegetables and Sue cooks and bakes. We never did those things in London. Sue's writing a book and I run a website for people like us who want to change their lives.  … '
