Living with your parents

In Britain, young people often move out of their parents' home in their late teens and early twenties. Is this also true in Canada and Australia? Young people wrote and told us what they think.

'In Britain, teenagers leave home to go to university at eighteen. In our culture, we think it is good to be independent. We often stay in university halls of residence or we share houses with other students. You have to pay rent, pay electricity bills and do your own shopping. When they leave university, many students don't want to return home and lose their independence. When you live with your parents, you have to do what they say. You mustn't stay out late. You mustn't invite friends to stay. It isn't easy to live in your parents' house after you have lived on your own or with friends.'

'In Australia, these days, more young people live with their parents than in the past. In fact, statistics show that 23% of people aged from twenty to thirty-four live at home. In 1986, the number was only 19%. Why are more people staying at home? Well, it's because people aren't getting married young these days. People are staying at home and staying single. I moved to London two years ago, and I was surprised by how many young people don't live with their parents. It's a lot more than in Australia.'

'In Canada, 40% of 25-year-old men live at home with their parents. In the past, you left school at sixteen or eighteen, then you got a job and got married. But today, you don't have to get married young and you don't have to leave education. That's why people stay at home.'
