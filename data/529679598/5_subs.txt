Sam: Hello, Nectar Design, Sam Wells speaking.
Maisy: Hi, Sam, it's Maisy Walton.
Sam: Hi, Maisy, how are you? What are you doing?
Maisy: I'm on a train. I'm travelling to London for a meeting with Lewis.
Sam: Oh, OK. Are you feeling OK today? You looked tired last week.
Maisy: Yes. I'm fine thanks. I'm sitting in first class and I'm looking at some documents on my laptop.
Sam: Great. Are you ready to meet Lewis?
Maisy: Yes. I'm preparing my presentation now. Are you working?
Sam: Yes, I'm reading my emails. There are about 300 in my inbox.
Maisy: Can you email me a document? Have you got time?
Sam: Of course. What do you want me to do?
Maisy: I can't find the design file for Lewis's project. I'm searching for it at the moment.
Sam: No problem. Yes, here it is. I'm sending it to you now.
Maisy: Thanks, Sam, you're a star!
