Ricardo: Good morning, Chandler. Monday's here again! What's happening this week?
Chandler: Hello, Ricardo. Why don't I start with the most important things first?
Ricardo: Good idea. I know I'm going out to dinner with Teresa on Thursday evening.
Chandler: That's correct. At 8 p.m. It's your wedding anniversary.
Ricardo: Now, what am I doing today?
Chandler: Well, it's 8 a.m. now and you're making a conference call to Madrid at 9 a.m. to discuss the new contract. Then you're having lunch with Ben James at 1 p.m.
Ricardo: OK. He's showing me some new computer software. Anymore?
Chandler: No, that's it for Monday. On Tuesday you're running with Charlie Farmer. That's at 7 a.m.
Ricardo: 7 a.m.?! OK.
Chandler: Is that too early?
Ricardo: No, 7 a.m. is good. Charlie's running a marathon next week. When am I meeting with Simon Lock?
Chandler: That's on Wednesday, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Ricardo: 3 p.m. Wednesday. Good. Thanks. He's organising a meeting with some Chinese businessmen.
Chandler: On Tuesday afternoon at 4 p.m. you're talking to Business TV about your new business plan for Brazil.
Ricardo: No problem. Is that all?
Chandler: That's it. You're not working on Friday, remember? You're travelling to Paris with your family. 
Ricardo: Of course! Brilliant. What time are we leaving?
Chandler: You're catching the Eurostar at 7 p.m. You're meeting Teresa and the children at St Pancras station. You're staying in Paris on Friday night and then going to Disneyland at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
