Diane: Hello, Stuart. What are you doing?
Stuart: Oh, hello Diane. I'm writing a report for my manager.
Diane: OK. Are you having problems with it?
Stuart: Well, it's just a long report, that's all.
Diane: Oh, OK. Are you feeling OK?
Stuart: Yes, I'm fine. Why are you asking?
Diane: I'm worried about you. At the moment, you're going to work at 7:00 a.m. and you aren't getting home until 10:00 p.m.
Stuart: I know. I've got a lot of projects. I'm working very hard.
Diane: Well, yes. Are you finding time to relax? Are you playing tennis these days, or going to the gym?
Stuart: No, I'm not playing tennis or doing exercise. In fact, I'm working and eating and sleeping.
Diane: How's Isabel?
Stuart: She's OK, I think. She's spending a lot of time at work as well. She isn't having a very good time.
Diane: Look. I'm not doing much at the moment. Why don't I look at that report?
Stuart: Oh, thanks, Diane.
