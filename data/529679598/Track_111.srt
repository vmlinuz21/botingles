B: Good morning, what’s the matter?

A: Well, I have a terrible headache every day in the morning. I’m taking aspirin but I’m not feeling any better. Also, I started sneezing yesterday and I think I have a cough [locutor coughs]. I think I need some antibiotics.

B: Mm, ok let’s see. How are you feeling at the moment?

A: Right now, I have terrible backache and my neck hurts.

B: Right, well it's not pneumonia, it's just a simple cold. Let’s have a look at your habits. Do you do exercise?

A: Well, not really. I work long hours so I’m sitting all day long. I don’t have time. 

B: Do you smoke? 

A: Er, yes. I know you told me to stop smoking, but it’s very hard for me. I’m a very nervous person.

B: So you usually feel stressed?

A: Yes, all the time [locutor coughs]. My job is very stressful, I’m worried about all the work I have to do.

B: If you want to get better, you must stop smoking, you know that. Also, I think you should do some exercise. It’s good for the body and the mind, it can help you relax. Walking to work or not using the lift could be a good start. 

A: And what should I do about the pain in my neck and back?

B: Here’s a prescription for a painkiller but you have to do some sport too!
