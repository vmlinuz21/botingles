Good afternoon. So, you want to give up smoking? Good. Now, here are some instructions to help you.
You have to decide to stop. Write a list of the reasons why you want to stop. When you want a cigarette, look at your list.
You must stop completely. Choose a date for stopping and stop.
You must throw away things that make you think about smoking.
When people give up tobacco, you often feel ill so you have to prepare for this.
Common problems are headaches, coughs, a sore throat, depression and sometimes insomnia.
You must think about what you eat. When people give up smoking, they often eat more food. You should eat fruit and vegetables and not burgers and coke.
Don't worry: it isn't easy. People try many times before they actually give up.
And don't forget alternative medicine. Acupuncture and hypnosis are all good ways to help you to stop but you choose what you want to try.
