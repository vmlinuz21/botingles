Martin: Hello and welcome to The World of Work here on UK Radio South. On the line is Louise Samson. She's got a story for us. Hello, Louise.
Louise: Hello, yes, thank you Martin. My story is about my first job interview.
Martin: I see.
Louise: Before the interview, I looked for information about the company.
Martin: Good.
Louise: Yes, but I wasn't very careful when I read the information about the company.
Martin: In what way?
Louise: I didn't look at the names of the people in the company. Particularly the people who did the job interviews. One of them was called Alan White. Anyway, when I arrived I was very confident and then I walked into the room and saw him.
Martin: Him?
Louise: Alan White. Before I moved to Birmingham, I lived in Glasgow and I had a boyfriend. His name was Alan White.
Martin: Ah. How did you feel?
Louise: Very uncomfortable. He recognised me but I thought he was very unfriendly. I started to talk very fast. The other interviewers thought I didn't know about the job. I answered some questions correctly but when Alan looked at me or asked a question, I felt nervous and said foolish things.
Martin: And after the interview?
Louise: Alan rang me and told me I didn't get the job. He said he was surprised when I walked into the room and he wanted me to get the job. But the other interviewers thought I was nervous, uncomfortable and unfriendly. We talked and he told me about a job in another company. I was very well-prepared for that interview and I got the job.
