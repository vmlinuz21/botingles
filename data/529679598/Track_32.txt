Robert: Hello Michelle and welcome to the Robin School of English. I'm Robert, I'm the director of the school. 
Michelle: Hello.
Robert: Can I ask you a few questions about your English?
Michelle: Of course.
Robert: Thank you. OK, first, what do you prefer doing in English?
Michelle: Oh, reading and writing. I like grammar, spelling and exams.
Robert: Good. Why don't you like speaking?
Michelle: I feel very shy.
Robert: I see. Is this your first visit to England?
Michelle: Yes.
Robert: At school in France, is your teacher French or English?
Michelle: She is French.
Robert: And does your teacher usually speak to you in English or in French?
Michelle: In French.
Robert: OK, Michelle, I think that you are not very confident.
Michelle: Yes.
Robert: May I give you some advice?
Michelle: Yes, please.
Robert: You are in England now. You should read and write and learn new words. That's very good. But, you shouldn't only do those things. You should talk to English people every day. The teachers here are all English. You should ask them questions and talk in class. You should make English friends. Finally, you shouldn't feel shy and you shouldn't worry about mistakes when you are speaking.
