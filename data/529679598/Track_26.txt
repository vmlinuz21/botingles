I met my wife, Helen, at a Christmas party. I offered to buy her a drink and she accepted. I got her the drink but then I fell over and the drink went all over her. I thought she was quite annoyed but actually she just laughed. I knew then that she was a very special girl and I invited her to a restaurant. I bought some flowers and some chocolates and we went out for dinner. When we arrived at the restaurant, I gave her the flowers but the chocolates fell to the floor, under the table. When I looked for the chocolates, I hit my head on the table. Helen took me to hospital and I met her dad for the first time. He's a hospital doctor. He checked my head and told Helen to take me home.
