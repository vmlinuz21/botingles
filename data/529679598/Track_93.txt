Interviewer: Elizabeth, you've had an interesting life. What's the most memorable thing you've ever done?

Elizabeth:   I've started several businesses, I'm a millionaire and I've travelled the world but the best thing I've ever done is to have my daughter. Rosie was born 20 years ago and she's wonderful!

Interviewer: You've travelled a lot. What unusual places have you visited? Apart from Mount Everest and Machu Picchu, of course.

Elizabeth:   Those were unusual, and amazing places! Let me see. I've been to the Arctic Circle. And I went to Easter Island the same year, 2006. They were both very unusual places.

Interviewer: Final question. On your travels, have you ever eaten any strange or unusual foods?

Elizabeth:   Oh yes! I visited the Amazon forest in 2003. A plate of food arrived and when I looked, I saw that it was a toad with some strange rice and a kind of omelette. It was the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth.
