Interviewer: Did you vote at the last general election?
Female interviewee: Yes.
Interviewer: Are you going to vote at the next general election?
Female interviewee: Definitely not, no! Politicians never listen to voters. It's a waste of time.
Interviewer: Do you think politicians do a good job?
Female interviewee: No, not at all. They do a terrible job.
Interviewer: Should people pay more for healthcare, education and so on?
Female interviewee: Yes, definitely. I completely agree with that. Healthcare and education are paid for by everyone. However, people who earn more money should pay more for healthcare. That's fair.
Interviewer: Some people think that politicians do not find solutions to problems.
Female interviewee: I completely agree. Politicians argue with each other far too much. They're only worried about their own lives, not the lives of real people.
