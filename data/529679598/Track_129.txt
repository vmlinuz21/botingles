Dan: Hi Mum. It's Dan. Look. These house rules. They're really strict.
Mum: Well, I know that you like being independent, Dan. But it's my house. You mustn't break the rules.
Dan: OK. I understand that. And, sure, I mustn't play loud music and I mustn't make a mess in the kitchen. I am fine with those rules. But what about my friends? I want to invite them to stay sometimes.
Mum: I know you do. And I also know that your friends are noisy and rude. That's a strict rule. I'm not changing it.
Dan: OK. But you can't tell me to go to bed early. I like staying up late sometimes.
Mum: But you're very noisy when you stay up.
Dan: Look. OK. I'm going to be quiet.
Mum: OK ... You don't have to go to bed early. And you don't have to stay in every night. You can go out late. But you mustn't make a noise and you mustn't bring friends home. And you mustn't make all those late night phone calls.
Dan: OK, OK. I agree with that. Fine.
Mum: Well, I'm glad that you understand. Do you agree with my rules?
Dan: Well, yes, sure, I have to.
Mum: So, when are you moving back home?
Dan: Er ... I'm not sure now. I think I'll go and live with my friends instead ...
