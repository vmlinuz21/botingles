Presenter: Hello. I'm Paul Croft. Welcome to People We Know. In this show I meet famous people and ask questions. On today's show, I'm talking to three famous comedians, sitcom star Susie Finn, international comedian Jeff Lowe, and TV presenter Jo Hall. Hi.

But I think that British humour and American humour are both very funny. In fact, my favourite comedy programmes aren't American.
