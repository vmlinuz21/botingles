Louise: Mum ... When you were my age, did you have fun?
Sandra: Have fun? Yes, of course, darling. I loved being seventeen.
Louise: Really? I think it's dead boring. What did you do?
Sandra: Well, lots of things ... I was interested in sport, so I used to play tennis every Saturday morning, and I used to watch football with my dad. Sometimes we went to see a game because we used to live near the football stadium, but we usually just watched it on TV.
Louise: Did you use to go out, mum?
Sandra: When I was 17? Oh yes, yes, I did. I went out every Saturday night. My friends and I used to go dancing.
Louise: Dancing? Really? I didn't know.
Sandra: Oh yes. I used to go to the Skybar. It was big and very cool. There used to be a lot of attractive boys there.
Louise: Mum!!
Sandra: I really enjoyed Saturday nights. It was great.
Louise: Well, I think being seventeen is boring, especially at the weekends. I chat with friends online all the time but we hardly ever go out. We never go to nightclubs. We just hang out in the shopping centre or we go shopping.
Sandra: OK. So, why not phone your friends now? Go dancing with them. Young people today - they never meet their friends or go out!
