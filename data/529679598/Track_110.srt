Hello, Olsen. I’m very happy you’re coming to live with us. Before you move, you should know we have some rules. We’re going to share the housework. It’s better if we don’t want problems. We have prepared a timetable with all the tasks. 
There are some instructions you have to follow: we do the hoovering between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. because it’s noisy. You have to take the rubbish out after 6 p.m. and separate plastic and paper. Also, when you clean the bathroom, you have 
to clean the floor, too. Then, we change the tasks every week and do different housework. What do you think? Call me when you want. Bye!
