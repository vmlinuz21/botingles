Anna: Hi, I'm Anna Korda, I'm a violinist and I'm from the Czech Republic but I live in London. I've played in several different orchestras and at some great concerts and festivals. I dream about playing at the opening ceremony of the Olympics. My job changes all the time. 
On the one hand, that's great because I do a lot of different things but on the other hand, it takes concentration because I often have to look for new jobs. 

Giles: I'm Giles Vine and I'm a theatre director from Scotland. I work with a company that wants audiences to think. For instance, our last show was about the environment. It started in darkness; all the lights were off and then the audience were played some strange music. 
We used a young violinist from the Czech Republic and she played beautifully. Recently we've started doing a lot of dance and using technology. Computers haven't often been combined with dance but it works really well. Our performances should be exciting. I don't want 
the audience to be bored! 

Merlin: My name is Merlin Davis and I come from Cardiff in Wales. Welsh people love music but I can't play an instrument or sing, so I work as a journalist, writing reviews for concerts or operas, and I love musicals! My work is great because I travel a lot and meet a lot of 
different people. Last month I saw an advertisement for Giles Vine's musical so here I am ready to see the first performance. I think it'll be amazing because I know the orchestra plays brilliantly and I've heard they use modern technology to make the show really special.
