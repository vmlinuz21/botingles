Saskia: Hi, I’m Saskia. I’m from Finland. I’m in England studying English, but I also speak Russian and I’m going to start learning French next year. I love learning new languages because Finnish isn’t a very popular language. My hobby is learning new words. 
I go to cafés or art galleries, you know, places full of people talking. Then I just sit and make notes of what they say and especially the words they use. I know I shouldn’t do it but it’s a great way to hear real people using their language and it’s less expensive 
than conversation classes! I also follow a lot of podcasts and I always listen to the radio on the internet when I’m home.

Francesco: I'm Italian and my name's Francesco. I've lived in England for about two years. People always tell me that I should speak to more English people but I'm quite shy. I have started to work on a travel blog. In my free time, I go to different places in the 
UK and then write about them. I always check my blog for mistakes. I use my dictionary and a grammar book. I think that's very important.

Christine: I’m French and my name is Christine. I have made a lot of friends in England. My flat is full of English books and magazines. I also read online papers every day.  I spend a lot of time reading! The newspapers in the UK are very interesting. They get very 
ngry about some topics like politics, art and sports. Tomorrow is Sunday and I’m meeting two English friends in a café. We’re going to have an English breakfast, read the Sunday newspapers and chat. Perfect!
