Andy: Hey Sal, I was thinking about a TV series we used to watch when we were young, and I wondered what happened to the actor. Do you remember Bus Man? 

Sally: Yes – the actor was John Radlock. Bus Man was a crazy driver but he solved murders! He chased those criminals faster than the police in his bus! 

Andy: That's right! Nobody investigated crime as bravely as Bus Man… But what happened to the actor, John? He disappeared from our lives almost as suddenly as he appeared – it's strange! 

Sally: Listen, I know about this. I was looking at the 'Where are they now?' webpage about actors. John became famous very quickly, but he didn't accept all the media attention as happily as 
other stars. He had no privacy. He argued with the show's promotors and left the series. I discovered he actually drives a school bus now! 

Andy: Really? No... you're joking. Well, I hope he drives more carefully than he did in the series! 

Sally: I am joking – I don't know what he does. But if he drives a school bus, I'm sure he will drive it well.
