The teacher asked the class about their habits studying English. Some results were surprising. For example, 16 students said they only study before exams. I think a good language learner practises every day. 22 students use a dictionary very often or always. 
That’s very good! Dictionaries give a lot of information, for example, meanings, pronunciation, examples, etc. And finally, 14 students prefer speaking. I understand, me too! But we should practise all four skills. Do you think these are good study habits?
