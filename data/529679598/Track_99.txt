My name's Kim Yee Foon and I work as a Producer for a TV company. My Mum's from Edinburgh and my Dad's from Hong Kong. I'm British but I was born in Hong Kong in 1982.
My family went to live near Edinburgh in 1991 but I've recently moved to London. I was at school in Edinburgh and then I started studying for a degree in Film Studies at Manchester University in 2003. I left university in 2006. I started working for BBC Scotland in 2008. I was a production assistant. I did that for one year and then I began working as a researcher.
I worked as a researcher for 2 years and then I became a production manager. I had that job for 3 years and then I took time off work to travel around the world and learn languages.
Now I speak Spanish, French and Chinese. I can drive - my dad has a farm so I started to drive a car when I was about 10 years old but I passed my test when I was 17! My interests are photography and salsa dancing. I also began doing Zumba fitness classes last month.
