Ross
My wife and I share the housework. It's about fifty-fifty. When one of us cooks, the other does the washing-up. Sue is a good cook, so she does the cooking. But she hates doing the washing-up, so I usually do it. With the cleaning, I sometimes do the hoovering and put the rubbish out. Oh, and I feed the cat and walk the dog every day before dinner. Sue cleans the floors, makes the beds and does the dusting. We both do the washing and the ironing.

We both work but when we're at home, I do the housework and Ross reads or listens to music. He thinks we share the housework, but we don't. On weekdays, I usually cook our dinner from Monday to Thursday and he cooks on Fridays, but he always makes a mess. I hate cleaning the kitchen after he cooks. When I cook, he offers to do the washing-up but then he doesn't do it; there's usually a TV programme he wants to watch. Anyway, I do the washing-up. And then I put the rubbish out. He usually sleeps on the sofa in front of the TV and so he doesn't see. After that, I do the ironing. Then I go to the living room and watch some TV. Ross is sleeping! At weekends, when Ross is out with his friends, I usually do the hoovering, the dusting, make the beds and do the washing. What does Ross do? Well, every evening, he feeds the cat and then he walks the dog - to the pub! That's all.
