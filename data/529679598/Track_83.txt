Hello there, this is Sandra from TopFlight Travel on High Street. I'm calling about your travel arrangements for this weekend. You wanted tickets for the 5 p.m. flight from Manchester. I'm sorry to say my colleague made a mistake. You're now leaving by train from London at 4 p.m. I hope that's OK. Thanks, goodbye.

Oh, hello again. Sorry, I forgot to tell you, you're arriving in Brussels at 8 p.m. and then you're travelling to Paris. Bye!

Hello, it's me, Sandra, from TopFlight Travel. I know you wanted us to book the Continental Hotel but it's full. So, you're staying at the Welcome Hotel on Friday night and then you're moving to the United Hotel for 2 nights, Saturday and Sunday. Then you're flying back on Monday at 2 p.m. Thanks again.
