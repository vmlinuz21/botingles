My name's Victor Fleary, I'm 25 years old and I'm applying for a job as a primary school teacher. I started working with children when I was 16. I was a summer camp monitor and I took younger children on trips and visits. I moved to London 5 years ago. That's when I began to train as a teacher in schools. I've never wanted to do another job. I started studying for my teaching degree at university 3 years ago and I finish this summer.

I'm Julia Stanley and I want to work in a restaurant kitchen as a chef. I began cooking when I was about 8 years old. I've always loved it! I moved to London 3 years ago, and I started to train as a chef one year later. I got a part-time job as a chef in a hotel kitchen in January. I've also done a degree in Hotel and Catering Management, so I've had a lot of experience. I began applying for jobs a month ago but this is the best job I've seen.
