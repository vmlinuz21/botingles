Doctor: So what's the matter, Mark?
Mark: I don't feel well at all. My head is hot and this morning, I can't speak.
Doctor: I see. Did you take any medicine?
Mark: Well, I had a cup of tea and I feel a bit better. But you can hear, my voice is very quiet.
Doctor: Yes. Do you have any other problems?
Mark: Yes, I felt sick yesterday and I vomited.
Doctor: Oh dear, I think you've got flu.

Doctor: Now, Anne, what's the matter?
Anne: It's my ankle. I can't walk because it hurts. I am very uncomfortable.
Doctor: Mmm, is that all?
Anne: No. My back ... I'm OK when I lie down but when I walk or sit, it hurts.
Doctor: I see. What about going to the bathroom?
Anne: It's not very good.
Doctor: OK, you may have constipation because you're not doing exercise.

Frank: Good morning, doctor.
Doctor: Good morning, Frank. What can I do for you? What's the matter?
Frank: I'm not feeling very well. I'm working a lot of hours at the moment and my job is very difficult.
Doctor: You are stressed at work.
Frank: I don't enjoy work and my boss isn't very nice. And last night, I didn't sleep. I'm very worried, doctor. What should I do?
