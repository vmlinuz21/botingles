Hello, Anna. I’m so happy you have this audition! Yesterday, I heard a director talking to an actor and I think I can help you. It’s very important that you learn your lines carefully. You can’t say your lines wrongly, that gives a bad impression. Also, you should speak naturally, not very slowly or very loudly. If you think you’re with your friends in that moment, you’ll talk honestly and will do it very well. 
Hope this helps. Call me after the audition, please. Break a leg!
