Simon: OK, good evening and welcome to the Happy House Residents' Association meeting. Sorry, John, do you want to say a few words?
John: Yes, I do. I always try to be polite but the Arnolds are terrible. They are less sociable than any of the other people in this apartment block.
Kate: I agree with John. They have wild parties every week and they're noisy ...
Fran: And the kids are rude all the time. In fact, the parents are as rude as the kids and they never smile.
John: That's right, Fran. And their daughter, Jolene, always invites her friends to the apartment.
Kate: Yes. Sometimes they're as noisy as elephants.
Fran: Their music is really bad.
John: The wife is very moody. She never speaks to me. I'm as friendly as I can be. I always say hello and she doesn't reply.
Simon: Really?
Fran: Mrs Arnold works in a supermarket. She never smiles. She's rude, unsociable and unfriendly!
Simon: Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that. But I do feel a bit sorry for her. She has to live with her husband and those horrible children. We don't!
John: That's true. Actually their son, Josh, isn't as rude as the rest of the family. He sometimes smiles!
Kate: Sometimes, but he's less sociable than us. And he's got that terrible dog. You have to talk to them, Simon.
Simon: Well, I wrote them a letter last week. Let's see ...
John: Yes, you did and I heard them arguing about it. They threw it in the rubbish bin. They aren't good neighbours.
Simon: OK, why don't I speak to them as soon as possible ...
