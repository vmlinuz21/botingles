Rebecca: OK. So, what's on in Bristol next Saturday?
Paul: Well, you want to go to a rock concert, right?
Rebecca: Er ... yes, but it's OK if there is something more interesting on. You know me. I prefer rock to soul or pop, but I like all sorts of music - hip hop, blues, folk, jazz ...
Paul: Jazz?
Rebecca: OK. Well, not jazz. It's a type of music that I'm not really interested in. But ...
Paul: Stacey Hall is on at the Jazz Club. I like her. I prefer her modern jazz to traditional jazz or Latin jazz ... Oh, and there's a restaurant at the club.
Rebecca: A restaurant? I don't want to eat in the restaurant. I prefer to eat at home before we go out.
Paul: You're right. OK ... So, we don't want to see the jazz and we don't want to go to see the classical music. I think the tickets are very expensive.
Rebecca: Mmm ... I prefer classical music to jazz but I don't want to pay a lot of money.
Paul: Me neither. Hey, there's a musical which I want to see.
Rebecca: I usually hate musicals.
Paul: I know, but this one has 1970s rock music. Your favourite.
Rebecca: Really?
Paul: Yes. Why don't we book tickets online for that?
Rebecca: OK. Good idea. What time does it start?
