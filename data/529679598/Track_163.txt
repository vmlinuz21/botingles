Rod Ellis: 
The girl at number 4 is a nurse and she works full time. She's a gentle person. She's quiet but she's very nice and so is her daughter. The kid can be a bit noisy sometimes, but I just turn my music up loud and play video games. I hardly ever talk to the neighbours. They're less interesting than my friends or my car.

Bill evans: 
The lady at number 2 is a widow. She's a very kind, polite lady. However, she does have a lot of cats and they're as messy as ... well, as a lot of cats. I play cricket in the garden with my two sons and we often have to clean up the garden. She also plays the piano very badly. The kids love her and I think she teaches them some good manners ... sometimes!

Sally Cookson: 
I'm a single parent. My husband left 4 years ago and we're divorced. My daughter Maisy is 10 and she's almost as tall as me! I work full time as a nurse so it's impossible to meet new people. I don't see my next door neighbour very often. He's single. He's quite rude and not very friendly. He often plays loud music ... He's always having parties and making a noise.

Elsie Trotter: 
I like my neighbours at number one. Their children are nice and polite, although they once broke my back window with a cricket ball. Their dog, Bones, is lovely but he isn't very friendly with my cats. The man at number 3 is single and he drives a very big sports car. He often plays loud music and has noisy parties with his friends. He's less friendly than Bill and his family.
