Maria Paschalidis is 76. She lives and works on the island of Crete. She owns a small bed and breakfast hotel and in the summer, she welcomes tourists from the UK, Germany and other countries to her home. She has also got a small farm and she grows almost all her own food. Maria never goes to the doctor and she says she is never ill. 'I went to the doctor once when I was a child. I twisted my ankle. My mother thought I had a broken leg.' She laughs. 'I sometimes catch a cold but I just eat some good soup and I stay in bed.' So what's her secret? 'I exercise outside every day on my farm, I eat fresh, healthy food, I make my own organic wine and I do yoga. Oh, and I don't smoke. Simple!

Ahnah is also 76. She is a member of an Inuit Tribe and she lives in the Arctic area of Alaska. The Arctic has long cold winters and short summers. As a young girl, Ahnah never ate fruit or vegetables. 'I ate some seaweed but I normally ate meat, fish or eggs from wild birds.' Depression is a problem in the Arctic because in winter the sun never shines. But Ahnah is a very healthy and active woman. She often hunts or goes fishing. This means she walks or sometimes runs for many hours in the snow. Ahnah explains. 'Doctors say we need vitamins and vegetables but we are Inuit people. We find our food and get exercise. We eat raw fish and meat from the sea.' The Inuit get lots of vitamins and minerals from eating meat, fish and eggs. Ahnah says, 'I can't remember the last time I saw a doctor or a dentist.'
