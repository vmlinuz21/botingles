7.170	13.920	My guest today is from the popular TV series Who wants to make a million? Ladies and gentleman, businesswoman Maria Papas.
13.920	17.970	Now, Maria, let's look back at your life!
17.970	22.470	Maria, you're Greek, and you were born in Athens.
22.860	30.870	Maria: That's right. I was born in Athens and I lived there for ten years. When I was three I went to a British school in Athens and then, when I was 11 I went to school in England.
31.350	35.310	Ed: Why did you go to school in England?
35.310	41.910	Maria: My father was Greek but my mother was English. So I went to my mother's school in England. It was a great school and my English teacher for the first three years was fantastic.

57.930	60.210	Maria: Yes, I was. But we talked for about 30 minutes about Greece. And after that I loved school. Thank you!
60.570	65.190	Ed: Thank you, Mrs Fletcher. And Maria, you were a businesswoman at school. Is that right?
65.760	68.790	Maria: Yes, my dad sent me chocolate from Greece but I didn't eat it. I sold it to the other girls. I made a big profit!
69.480	77.640	Ed: Well, you made a good start at school, Maria, and ...
