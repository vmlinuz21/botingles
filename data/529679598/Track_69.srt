Oxford Street in London is also a great place to find shoes, accessories and other things to wear. It's one of London's busiest streets and it's always full of people. There are many great shops to buy sports clothes and trainers.

When you're in New York, go to Fifth Avenue. Children and adults can find their perfect clothes. Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie and Fitch, Saks and many other department stores are all there. There's often a bargain, and clothes are sometimes cheaper
