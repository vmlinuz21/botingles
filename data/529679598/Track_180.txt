John: Do you always celebrate Passover in your family, Rachel?
Rachel: Oh, yes. It's a really important festival for us. 
John: When is it? Is it every year?
Rachel: Yes. It's in spring. But it's not always on the same date. It depends on the calendar. It can be in March or April. On the first day of Passover, we have a big family dinner, but then there is a holiday period that lasts seven days. Nobody works during Passover.
John: Oh right. So, what do you eat at the family dinner? Do you eat meat?
Rachel: Well, yes, we eat lamb. But the most important thing that we eat is a special type of bread. We call it matzo. And we also drink wine with the meal. Because it is a very important celebration, we all wear our best clothes and we use really nice plates and dishes. In fact, we have plates, dishes, knives and forks that we only use at Passover.
John: Really? So, what do you do after dinner?
Rachel: Well, we say prayers and we sing songs. That's really nice. Everybody in the family says a different prayer or sings a different song.
John: Nice. What do you do on the other days of the holiday?
Rachel: Well, it's a family time, really. We go on picnics. I think Passover is my favourite time of year.
