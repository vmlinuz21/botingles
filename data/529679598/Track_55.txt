1 Greg and Kara 
Greg: We share the cooking and washing-up, but I do the washing and she always makes the beds.
Kara: That's true. Oh, and I do the ironing, too.

2 Mum and Dad
Mum has to do everything. Sometimes, dad sits in the kitchen and talks to her, but he doesn't do any housework. Mum does all the cooking, all the hoovering and the ironing, too.

3 Ava and Josh
Ava: I do the cooking and he does the cleaning. You know, the hoovering. We both share the washing and we walk the dogs together.
Josh: Mm.

4 Emily and Daniel
Emily: We both work but I do nearly everything at home. OK, he does the washing-up sometimes and makes the bed sometimes.
Daniel: Um, yes, I suppose that's right.

5 Nick and Grace
Nick: We share the housework but I do the cooking. It's OK because I love cooking. I travel to a new country every year and learn some new dishes. I think my wife is lucky.
Grace: And he's lucky because I do all the washing and ironing and I never complain.
