Angus: Hello and welcome back to the News Review, with me, Angus Palmer. Let's start with you, Tanya. What have you chosen? 

Tanya: Well, I'm very interested in politics.  Last year, several important politicians were arrested by the police.

Angus: So why are you so interested? 

Tanya: Some businessmen paid these politicians to ask questions in parliament. That's against the law and it's serious. I'm always fascinated by serious stories. 

Angus: What about you Greg? 

Greg: I'm not interested in serious news so I've chosen a funny story about a man who thought that he was a lottery winner and that the first prize was over £4 million. 

Angus: Really? 

Greg: OK, he organised a big party and several journalists were invited. When they arrived, he was very, very unhappy! 

Angus: Why? 

Greg: Let me read the story. 'Lottery winner Mr Harvey Montgomery (42) told us, 'I've organised this party and I've paid for a new Porsche sports car. The problem is that yesterday they told me that the prize was shared by me and around 9,000 other people!' 
Mr Montgomery's share of the lottery prize was £500! 

Angus: That's funny ... and sad! OK. Georgina, what's your favourite type of story? 

Georgina: I love stories about animals. There's one I love about a dog that helped her owner to escape from a fire. 

Angus: Finally, I like unusual stories and sports. A grandmother in York has taken up karate. 'Maggie Floss is 83 and has become a model for younger people. Karate is taught in schools now as part of the sports programme.'
