Friends Reunited

Are you a student from St James's School, Manchester, 1980s?

I'm organising a school reunion! Do you remember me? I'm Paul 'Scotty' Scott and I went to St James's School from 1981–1986. Were you
in my class? Our teacher was Mrs King. I talked a lot and I didn't do any work, so I didn't pass my exams. [...] I am looking for people 
from my class, and I really want to find Harry Kelly. We met on the first day of school but he moved to London. Come to the reunion, 
Harry!

Were you in the County Hospital, Cambridge, 18 years ago?
18 years ago, I had my first baby, a beautiful daughter, Octavia. She was born in the County Hospital, Cambridge. I didn't sleep a lot
and for 10 days the nurses and doctors looked after Octavia. They were very kind, but I can't remember their names. [...] Octavia had 
her 18th birthday last week and I want to say 'Thank you!'

Did you work in the Railway Hotel, Oxford, between 1920 and 1970?
My name is Pauline Thomas and I'm writing a history of the Railway Hotel in Oxford. My father died in 1956, when I was very young.
I first visited the hotel with my mother in 1957. She went there with my father in 1932. I went to Oxford last year, to walk around 
the city. It was very romantic. I want to find stories about the hotel for my book. [...] Thank you for your help.
