Martyn: I've only had this job for a couple of months and I've already decided that working from home is brilliant! I've got four people working for me and I can be flexible with my hours. I've worked in big offices since I got my degree in Industrial Design and I wanted a change. I love it!

Carol: Every day is different in my job. I've already been in three different places today and I haven't finished work yet. I'm my own boss and I've got a van for all the cleaning equipment.

Chris: I love my job and I love riding my motorbike to different places. This week I've already visited France, Scotland and London. I've worked for this company for 18 months. Since I left school, actually. I haven't been to Spain yet but a client from Saragossa called yesterday so I'm going to ask the boss about that job!

Amanda: I'm 23 and I work about 9 hours a day but I usually work in the evenings and at night. I'm still learning about the job so I haven't earned much money yet, but I think I'm good on the telephone. I enjoy talking to people.
