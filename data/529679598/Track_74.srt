 ... Raymond and Martha Shelley are a retired couple living in Derby. Last week they won 2 million euros. 

Martha told us ‘On Friday we're taking our family to London for the weekend. We're going out for dinner and then on Saturday we're all seeing a musical. On Sunday, we're taking a ride on the London Eye and touring the city in a limo!’. 

'Apart from that, we're not making any plans. We're both retired and we don't want to change the way we live. We own our house, we like our neighbours and we've got a nice car', added Raymond. 
'Now our family can stop worrying about money. Our son, Alan, wants to give up his job and he's going to start a new business with his wife, Paula. Thank you, LuckyWinners.com!' 

 ... Joanna and David Cornish got married last year. They live in a rented house in South London. They want to start a family. 'I can't believe it!', said Joanna. 'We're planning to leave work and travel the world. We're going to book the trip 
tomorrow. 4.5 million euros is a lot of money. My husband is going out on Saturday to buy a sports car! We're going to move to a bigger flat or maybe even a house. We're also changing our looks. Dave is growing a beard, and I'm getting 
a new haircut! In the next few days, I'm going to throw away all our old clothes and buy new ones. We're having a party next weekend for all our friends and family. It's fantastic! Thank you, LuckyWinners.com Lottery!'
