When we rehearse, that's when we practise the play before we perform in the theatre. We usually start work at about ten o'clock in the morning and we finish at six. At the moment, I'm actually in the theatre. The play starts at half past seven, but I always arrive at half past six. The play finishes at ten o'clock so I usually get home about eleven.
2.700	3.420	2 I'm a busker. What's a busker? Well, a busker plays music in public for money. I work in the London Underground, at Leicester Square. People give me money when I play. I always start at about 10 p.m. I haven't got regular hours of work. I stop for a break at about 11:30. When do I finish? That depends. On a good night, I make a lot of money so I stay until one or two o'clock in the morning.
3.750	5.400	3 I work for the police. I'm an investigator. You know, CSI Miami! I don't work regular hours - I sometimes start work at nine o'clock in the morning and I sometimes finish after midnight. Do I get bored at work? Not really. Every day is different and interesting.
