Doctor: Hello. Now, tell me, how are you?
Patient: Well, I'm not feeling very well, Doctor.
Doctor: OK. What's the matter?
Patient: I play a lot of tennis and I'm having problems.
Doctor: With your elbow?
Patient: No, it's my shoulder. I can't move it. I've got a terrible pain.
Doctor: OK.
Patient: And my back.
Doctor: What's the matter with your back?
Patient: It hurts.
Doctor: I see. Is that all?
Patient: I can't hear in my left ear.
Doctor: Right. OK. Any more problems? Have you got a temperature?
Patient: Yes, I have, but I took some aspirin this morning.
Doctor: I see.
Patient: What can I do?
Doctor: First, don't play tennis for some time. Secondly, I know you eat well and you do exercise and that's great but I think you have to relax for a couple of weeks. I'm giving you a prescription for some painkillers and vitamins.
