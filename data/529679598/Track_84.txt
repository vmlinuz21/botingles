Natalie: So, when are we going to have a party?
Andy: I don't know. It's going to be Blake's birthday next month. Is he going to have a party?
Chris: No. He's visiting Rome for the weekend.
Natalie: Really? Who's he going with?
Chris: He's taking his girlfriend.
Andy: Oh. So when are we going to have a party?
Natalie: What about having a dinner party on Friday night?
Chris: No. I'm cooking dinner on Thursday night for Anna so I'm not making dinner again on Friday.
Andy: Jean and Mick are going to organise a Christmas party at work.
Natalie: Yes but that's at work. I want a party with friends.
Andy: What about having one this weekend?
Chris: I can't. I'm going to go to my mum's place this weekend. We're going walking.
Natalie: And he's going to think about when to have a party.
Andy: Exactly!
