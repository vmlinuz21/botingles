Scott: OK, here I am in Macy's with my assistant Petra. This is a great store for lots of different clothes.
Petra: What are we shopping for today, Scott?
Scott: Today we're shopping for two clients. Matilda Swanson is a singer and she wants some jeans, a shirt and a new coat. Erica Jones works in marketing and she needs a jacket, a dress and boots. Easy!
Petra: I'm looking at coats and jackets now. Look at these. Here's a long coat for Matilda and a beautiful jacket for Erica. The jacket is leather.
Scott: They're great. Now, what about a dress for Erica? There's a blue dress and a white dress. The white dress is size medium so perhaps it's too long. I'll buy the blue dress, it's woollen and the size is right - small.
Petra: Just a minute, Scott, those are great jeans. They're green - Matilda's favourite colour. Let's buy those! Have they got a medium pair?
Scott: OK. Now, boots for Erica and a shirt for Matilda. I like those brown boots. They're very fashionable. They're leather too.
Petra: Great!
Scott: Finally, a shirt for Matilda. I like the pink, cotton one but it's very loose. It's extra large, so no to the pink shirt. Right, this shirt is perfect. It's white and it's cotton and I'm buying it right now!
