Hello, Ceri. Next weekend I’m going away with some classmates. We’re going to Segovia. It’s a historic city near Madrid. We’re leaving on Friday after lunch and we’re going by train. We’re meeting at Atocha station at 3:30 p.m. There are many trains to Segovia. 
We can go sightseeing and try typical food (roast pork!) I know you’re a vegetarian, but, don’t worry, they have other delicious and typical dishes. We don’t know where we’re sleeping. We have to book. If you’d like to come with us, call me. I think you’d love it!
