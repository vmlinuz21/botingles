Hello. 
I listened to two people on the radio yesterday. They talked about their life experience abroad. There was an English woman, Valentina. She lived in Russia when she left home. Then, she studied in Paris and found love there for the first time. 
She felt very happy with this French boy, but I ask myself… is a different language a problem for a relationship? What do you think?
